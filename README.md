Extracting text from text-based and image-based (OCR) PDF files
Python modules such as PyPDF2, pytesseract, image2pdf, and fastapi are used in this project
The project is meant to have a front end where users can upload their pdf file and the text in these files are returned to the display.
We then store the exttracted text in memory, and interract with the gpt api on the back-end.
The API answers questions based on the client's questions, using the pdf text as a guide.
Project is complete, but requires funding for the openAI API key
